# SociallyDistantGroupedSeatingWrapper
Consumes SignUpGenuis API for a sign-up, reads a JSON of available seating, and makes necessary calls to SociallyDistantGroupedSeating to seat according to preferences specified on a Java form.  Can also read a configuration file in the running directory named SociallyDistantGroupSeatingWrapperConfig.json to initalize the fields
It is customized for St. John Evangelical Lutheran Church in Wheaton, Illinois - but designed so that you can modify the JSON parsing and output file code easily to fit your needs without needing to make modifications to the underlying logic package
Example/Test input and output data are included in the data folder
